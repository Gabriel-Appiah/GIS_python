The study area for this project is the four counties (Cherokee, Plymouth, Ida, and Woodbury County) within the Iowa portion of Siouxland Interstate Metropolitan Planning Council. From Figure 2 the study area is located in the northwestern portion of the State of Iowa. Some of the counties bordering the study area include Union County, SD; Dakota County, NE; Monona, IA; Crawford, IA, Sac County, IA, among others. According to the 2010 decennial census, the total population of the study area was 146,319 in 2010, with 8.5% living in Cherokee County, 4.8% living in Ida County, 17.1% living in Plymouth County, and the remaining 69.8% living in Woodbury County. The estimates from the 2018 American Community Survey show that the population of the study area decreased to 145,962 in 2018, representing a decline of 0.24%. The counties within the study area that experienced a major decline in population between 2010 and 2018 were Cherokee County and Ida County. This trend is partly due to the rural nature of these counties. While Woodbury County and Plymouth County on the other hand experienced population growth from 2010 to 2018 by 0.4% and 0.2% respectively.
